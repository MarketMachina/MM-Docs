### 4. Services in Quality Assurance

The following services have been developed and are undergoing testing and refinement:

#### 4.1 AI Consensus Analysis of Trader Ideas
A suite of AI agents aggregates and analyzes publicly available trading ideas from professional traders. The result is a concise, consolidated report highlighting the most valuable and timely insights, empowering users to make informed decisions faster.

#### 4.2 Automated and Manual Trading Systems
Three core trading systems are currently in testing, each available in two modes:

- **Manual Mode:** Provides alerts and signals, empowering traders to execute strategies manually.  
- **Automated Mode:** Fully autonomous algorithms capable of trading directly on users’ exchange accounts (currently supporting Binance and ByBit, with DEX integration upcoming).

##### 4.2.1 On-Chain Metrics System
Leverages modified on-chain metrics—NUPL, AVIV, MVRV, and Reserved Risk. By analyzing metric data within a rolling window, the system calculates Z-scores to identify four dynamic trading zones. Each zone is associated with specific trading rules, allowing the strategy to effectively respond to diverse market conditions.

##### 4.2.2 Basket Spread System
A market-neutral strategy that trades between two highly correlated baskets of instruments. It profits from the temporary deviations in their normalized price dynamics, utilizing a statistical arbitrage approach.

##### 4.2.3 Imbalance System
Examines buyer- and seller-initiated volumes within a rolling window to detect statistically significant imbalances. When anomalies occur, the system executes trades accordingly.

#### 4.3 Manual Technical Analysis Overlays
Professional traders maintain medium- and long-term price channels with key support/resistance zones. This visual guidance complements automated signals, providing additional clarity for trade decision-making.

---

### 5. Services in Development

As the ecosystem grows, new services are under active development:

#### 5.1 AI Portfolio Manager
A collection of AI agents processes vast amounts of data—including fundamental metrics, trending networks, actively growing sectors, social sentiment, influencer mentions, and volume-to-market-cap ratios—to construct an optimal, risk-adjusted investment portfolio.

#### 5.2 Cluster-Based Path Analysis
Employs a two-stage process:
1. Pattern Identification: ML algorithms detect fundamental price patterns within market data.  
2. Sequential Regularity Detection: Statistical models analyze the sequences of these patterns to identify repeatable and significant transitions.

#### 5.3 Volatility Breakout System
Monitors assets undergoing prolonged price consolidation and identifies early stages of volatility explosions. Upon detecting a breakout, the system promptly issues signals, allowing traders to capitalize on strong price movements.

#### 5.4 DEX Executor
A decentralized execution engine enabling automated trading signals to be executed directly through decentralized liquidity pools. It will also feature an advanced trading interface with diverse order types, effectively bringing core centralized exchange functionalities to decentralized platforms.

---

### 6. Future Service Pipeline

Beyond the aforementioned offerings, an additional seven innovative services are in various stages of research and proof-of-concept. The project’s dynamic roadmap guarantees the ongoing development of advanced trading strategies, AI-powered tools, and versatile services, tailored to meet evolving user needs and diverse use cases.

---

### 7. Long-Term Initiatives

#### 7.1 Investment DAO
Market Machina plans to launch a fully transparent, community-governed investment pool operating on immutable smart contracts. Each epoch (one week), token holders will allocate funds across various instruments—both internal systems and external products—by voting with **veMACHINA**, a governance token awarded to MACHINA stakers.

The voting power will be influenced by the holder’s epoch-by-epoch decision-making performance, providing a merit-based system that rewards historically effective allocators.

#### 7.2 Decentralized Percentage Allocation Money Management (DPAMM) Accounts
DPAMM accounts bring the concept of Percentage Allocation Money Management to the decentralized realm. Structured as transparent and rules-based investment pools on DEXs, DPAMM accounts will interest both traders seeking to manage external capital and investors looking for curated, profit-sharing opportunities.

Key parameters—such as leverage, investment caps, profit-sharing ratios, and loss compensation frameworks—will be customizable. This flexibility enables unique, trustless arrangements between traders and their backers. Funds locked in these DPAMM accounts will only be accessible at the end of each epoch, ensuring predictable and stable capital flows.

---

### 8. Staking

Staking MACHINA tokens enables participants to earn rewards while granting full access to the ecosystem's services upon meeting the required minimum stake and allowing governance participation.

**Key Staking Features:**  
- **Epoch-Based:** Staking periods align with epochs starting every Thursday at 00:00 UTC. Rewards and lock durations are tracked by these discrete intervals.  
- **Fixed Yield on Lock-In:** The yield rate is fixed at the time of staking initiation and remains unchanged for the entire lock period, ensuring predictability of returns.  
- **Reward Distribution:** Rewards are distributed in full at the end of the staking period. Partial reward withdrawals are not provided (?).  
- **Voting:** Stakers receive veMACHINA at the end of each epoch, granting them voting rights in the new feature development and the Investment DAO, thereby influencing strategic decisions.

---

### 9. Tokenomics
**Total Supply:**  
A total of 10 billion MACHINA tokens will be issued, with a fixed supply enforced through immutable smart contracts, ensuring no additional tokens can be minted or issued beyond this cap.

#### 9.1 Token Allocation
- **Presale (35%)**: Initial funding and liquidity formation through early investments.  
- **Marketing (5%)**: Targeted campaigns to enhance brand visibility and user acquisition.  
- **Research and Development (10%)**: Released at 0.4% of the total supply monthly over 25 months, starting after the commencement of trading, to sustain ongoing innovation in AI, quantitative models, and system capabilities.  
- **Team and Strategic Partnerships (5%)**: Resources to attract and retain top talent and form strategic alliances that foster long-term growth.  
- **Ecosystem (10%)**: Staking rewards and incentives for community contributions to the project’s evolution.  
- **Liquidity (35%)**: Providing liquidity on trading platforms.

#### 9.2 Utility and Value Proposition
MACHINA tokens grant access to the full spectrum of Market Machina’s services. Additionally, stakers receive veMACHINA governance tokens to influence ecosystem direction and the deployment of capital in the DAO.

The value of MACHINA tokens is bolstered by the platform’s continuous innovation and growth. The rising number of service users increases the amount of tokens locked in long-term staking, thereby amplifying demand.
